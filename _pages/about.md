<p style="font-size:80%;">
	I am currently a visiting scientist at the Broad Institute, working with Dr. <a href="https://www.finucanelab.org/">Hilary Finucane</a> on fine-mapping. In March 2019, I completed my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/xihong-lin/">Xihong Lin</a>. My dissertation was entitled "Transformation and Multivariate Methods for Improving Power in Genome-wide Association Studies." Previously, I worked with Dr. <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/iidl/pi/enviro-gen/index.cfm">Steven Kleeberger</a> at the National Institute of Envrionmental Health Sciences on the genetic basis of lung disease. I obtained my B.S.P.H. in Biostatistics and B.S. in Quantitative Biology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
